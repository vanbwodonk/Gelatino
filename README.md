# Gelatino #

Other Arduino Compatible Core Project

Gelatino is Arduino core for another AVR 8-bit besides Arduino mostly used. 
Gelatino now is suported ATmega128 ,ATmega16, ,ATmega162 and ATmega32
Download this patch and overwrite in arduino-1.6.x/hardware/arduino/avr folder.

*Last tested on arduino-1.6.8

## Variants ##

Gelatino have 4 variants:
- Gelatino16  with ATmega16
- Gelatino162 with ATmega162
- Gelatino32  with ATmega32
- Gelatino128 with ATmega128

## Gelatino Pinlist ##

See pinlist on arduino variant folder (hardware/arduino/avr/variants).
Now have new macros same with AVR pin, no need to remember what number and where is digital pin. Example below,
```
pinMode(PB_5, OUTPUT);  //set PinB.5 as output
digitalWrite(PB_5, HIGH); //set PinB.5 High
```
